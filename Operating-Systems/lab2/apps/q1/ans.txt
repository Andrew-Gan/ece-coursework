1. 32 semaphores are available (include/os/synch.h)
2. 64 locks are available. (include/os/synch.h)
3. By calling SemCreate() with the number of Semaphores needed as argument. The handler of the semaphores is returned. (os/synch.c)
4.  SemWait() decrements the counter on the semaphore and suspends the process if the counter is below 0. (os/synch.c)
    SemSignal() signals
5. A handle is an integer number that often serves as the index of semaphore in the array. 
   The handle of the semaphore is obtained when calling SemCreate(). To access the semaphore, we use the handle to index 
   the sempahore in the array.
