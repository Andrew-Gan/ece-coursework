Scenario:   
Manufacturing company produces several thermocouple designs, each with varying performance. Using the temperature data provided by the company, perform a statistical analysis and use the parameters such as SSE, variance, sample mean and the determined function type to calculate the best-fit equation for the data and conclude on the performance of the different designs.
