' This puzzle features many tiles that would lead to
' dead states if a box is pushed to them.
' The walls of the puzzle are designed to have U-shaped
' structures with many corners so that many dead states
' can be precomputed and cached before search begins.

' This puzzle contains many possible movements of the 
' player. If ucs algorithm is used, a lot of time would 
' be wasted by since the player needs to travel to a 
' number of unnecessary locations. F algorithm focuses 
' on box movements instead of player movements. In this 
' puzzle, the possible box movement is very limited, which 
' means the state it needs to explore is much less than 
' ucs algorithm does, therefore the computation is 
' reduced.

' This puzzle is intuitive to solve, but it has a lot of
' empty space for movement. Without a simple distance
' heuristic function, the program may move the boxes in

' This puzzle can't be solved with a heuristic which just uses
' distance from box to target as a metric because the second box from
' the top does not actually end up on the target to its right, which
' is unintuitve to a simple heuristc.

' This puzzle is unique because boxes that arrive on a target
' has to be further moved to reach the goal state which really
' tests the flexibily of the heuristic functions adopted.
' A heuristic function based solely on distance may take more time.
